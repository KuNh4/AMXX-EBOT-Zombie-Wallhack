# CVars
- ebot_wallhack "1" // 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
- ebot_wallhack_debug "0" // 0 = no debug, 1 = show debug messages
- ebot_wallhack_min_distance "0.0" // Bots only get forced to target if human is FURTHER than this
- ebot_wallhack_max_distance "4096.0" // Maximum detection distance (units)
- ebot_wallhack_hunt_interval "10.0" // How often to update bot targets (in seconds)

# Note
This plugin makes zombies to wander less around the map and hunt humans instead.

With it you don't need "terrorist specific" waypoints on camp entrances.

'Zombie Wallhack' was an available command on E-BOT Beta 1.10.

E-BOT Legacy R12 is known to be the most stable version to use with Zombie Mods in CS 1.6.
